# `torchd` â€“ call TorchScript models via HTTP

Simple C++ server to call `forward` on your TorchScript models from anywhere that can send HTTP requests.

## Installation

First, download and extract the [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) zip file.

Then, compile `torchd`:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/../libtorch ..
make
```

## Usage example

Get a TorchScript model, e.g., [traced_bert.pt](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/master/en/serialization#torchscript)

Start `torchd` server
```
torchd --model traced_bert.pt
```

Make an HTTP request
```
curl -F 'data={"inputs": [[[101, 2040, 2001, 3958, 27227, 1029, 102, 3958, 103, 2001, 1037, 13997, 11510, 102]], [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]]}' http://127.0.0.1:7000/forward
```

## Acknowledgements

Built with the excellent [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) and [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) libraries.
